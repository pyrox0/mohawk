      long_description="""
Hawk lets two parties securely communicate with each other using
messages signed by a shared key.
It is based on HTTP MAC access authentication (which
was based on parts of OAuth 1.0).

The Mohawk API is a little different from that of the Node library

It was redesigned to be more intuitive to developers, less prone to security problems, and more Pythonic.
